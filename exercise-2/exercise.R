# Create a variable `friends` equal to the number of friends you would like to eat with
friends <- 5

meal.price <- 15

# Create a variable `total.cost` that has the total cost of your bill
total.cost <- 75

# Create a variable 'total.cost.tip' to be the total cost including a 15% tip
total.cost.tip <- 86.25

# Create a variable 'price.limit' set to your spending budget
price.limit <- 80

# Create a boolean variable `too.expensive`, set to TRUE if the cost with the tip is greater than the price limit
too.expensive <- TRUE

# Create a variable `max.friends`, which is the maximum number of friends you can invite that is in range
# of your price limit
max.friends <- 4
